This program allows you to input student names either manually or by uploading a file and then assigns them to designated exam classrooms. It generates a seating chart matrix that displays each student's assigned seat in their respective classroom, making the seating process efficient when they arrive.
To update the student file with any changes you've made, simply select the "Update" prompt once you're satisfied. To generate the seating assignments and lists from the current student file, use the "Assign" prompt.
